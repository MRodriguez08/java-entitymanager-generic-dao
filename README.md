# java-entitymanager-generic-dao
This is a small project that uses generic daos to acces data. In this implementation we use the Spring Framework ORM EntityManager using a preconfigured dataSource to implement basic operations such as insert, update, delete and retreive entities from database.

## Technologies stack
This example uses:
* Spring Boot Framework (a main class implementing CommandLineRunner)
* Spring Transaction management + Spring JDBC
* Postgresql Database 9.2
* Apache Log4J
